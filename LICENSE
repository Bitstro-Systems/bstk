Bitstro Systems Developer License (BSDL)
Version 1.0

Copyright (c) Bitstro Systems
All rights reserved.

This Bitstro Systems Developer License (“License”) governs your use of
Bitstro Systems software development kits, tools, libraries, headers,
binaries, documentation, source code (if provided), and related materials
(collectively, the “Licensed Materials”).

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE LICENSED MATERIALS, YOU AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. LICENSE GRANT

Subject to your continued compliance with this License, Bitstro Systems
grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
license to:

a) Install and use the Licensed Materials solely for internal development,
   testing, evaluation, and maintenance of software applications or
   systems (“Products”);

b) Develop proprietary, closed-source, or commercial Products that depend
   on, interface with, or are built using the Licensed Materials;

c) Distribute Products you develop, including commercial distribution,
   provided such Products comply with the redistribution requirements
   set forth in Section 3.

No rights are granted except as expressly stated in this License.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SOURCE AVAILABILITY AND USE LIMITATIONS

The Licensed Materials may be provided in source code form solely for the
purpose of inspection, reference, debugging, and understanding how the
Licensed Materials operate and interact with your Product.

The Licensed Materials are source-available but not open-source.
Access to source code does not grant any right to modify, compile,
recompile, or redistribute it.

You must not represent, advertise, or imply that the Licensed Materials
are open-source or licensed under any open-source license.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS

You may distribute Products developed using the Licensed Materials,
including Products that include certain Licensed Materials in binary
form, only under the following conditions:

a) The Licensed Materials may be distributed solely as an integrated and
   inseparable part of your Product, and only to the extent strictly
   necessary for the Product to function as intended;

b) The Licensed Materials must not be distributed as a standalone,
   downloadable, installable, or reusable product, SDK, library,
   framework, or tool;

c) You must not provide the Licensed Materials in any manner that enables
   third parties to independently extract, reuse, download, install,
   access, or redistribute them apart from your Product;

d) You must not market, promote, or describe the Licensed Materials as a
   general-purpose SDK, framework, platform, or developer tool;

e) The primary purpose of any distribution must be the functionality of
   your Product, not the delivery or exposure of the Licensed Materials.

For clarity: distributing embedded runtime binaries solely to enable your
Product’s operation is permitted; distributing the Licensed Materials for
third-party development, access, or reuse is not.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. PRODUCT SCOPE LIMITATION

For the avoidance of doubt, “Products” do not include software, services,
platforms, or environments whose primary purpose is to provide
development, extension, scripting, integration, or execution capabilities
to third parties using the Licensed Materials.

You may not use the Licensed Materials to offer the functionality of the
Licensed Materials as a service, platform, SDK, or infrastructure to
third parties.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. RESTRICTIONS

Except as expressly permitted by this License, you must not, and must not
permit others to:

a) Modify, adapt, translate, enhance, patch, or otherwise alter the
   Licensed Materials, in whole or in part;

b) Compile, recompile, rebuild, or generate new binaries from the
   Licensed Materials, including from any source code made available to
   you;

c) Create derivative works of the Licensed Materials;

d) Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Licensed Materials,
   except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law;

e) Fork, mirror, publish, host, or otherwise make the Licensed Materials
   available, whether publicly or privately;

f) Redistribute, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise make
   the Licensed Materials available on a standalone basis;

g) Use the Licensed Materials to develop, assist in the development of,
   or enable competing SDKs, frameworks, platforms, system software, or
   developer tools;

h) Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices or labels contained
   in the Licensed Materials.

Mere inspection or analysis of the Licensed Materials is permitted; any
modification, recompilation, or derivative use is strictly prohibited.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

6. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Licensed Materials are licensed, not sold.

All right, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Materials, including
all intellectual property rights therein, remain exclusively with
Bitstro Systems and its licensors.

You retain ownership of your Products, excluding any Licensed Materials
contained therein.

No patent rights are granted under this License, except to the limited
extent necessary to use the Licensed Materials as expressly permitted
herein.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7. TRADEMARKS

This License does not grant you any rights to use Bitstro Systems’
trademarks, service marks, logos, or branding, except as required for
accurate identification of the Licensed Materials in unmodified form.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

8. TERMINATION

This License is effective until terminated.

Bitstro Systems may terminate this License immediately upon material
breach. For non-material breaches, Bitstro Systems may provide written
notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure prior to termination.

Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Licensed
Materials and destroy all copies in your possession or control.

Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall survive termination.
